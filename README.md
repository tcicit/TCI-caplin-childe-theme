https://www.andersnoren.se/teman/chaplin-wordpress-theme/

The theme can be used to display metadata entered in a post. 

The Theme requires the Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin. (https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/)

There is an example field group that can be imported into ACF.

There are two templates. In the first one, the metadata is displayed below the post content. The second template puts the content above the post image, you can make the data visible with the mouse.
